Git is the most popular open source version control system in the world. It has a special data base called a repository that records all the changes made to each coding project. This allows us to easily revert back into the project history to see who has made changes to what. By doing this, we can move back to an earlier version to avoid having srcew ups and unsuccesful alternations to the project.Github host these coding projects either in the cloud or on the web. This can make it so that collaboration is more accessible and tranparent. It can so manage each of the different changes we make so that each change can be track and tested without actually impacting the code by using a clone of itself. Using the Terminal is towards our benefit as it allows us to use simple commands to do tasks that would have been extra long, complicated, and repetitive. By using the Terminal, human error is kept to as much of a minimum as possible and using mutiple commands can build them into powerful expressions that are capable of doing things greater, better, and faster than we humans can ever hope to achieve.
